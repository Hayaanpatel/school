    <p>Through the 19th century, the electoral system went through many changes, but one constant remained. Women were
        not
        allowed to vote in national elections. In 1897, The Women's Social and Political Union was born on 10 October
        1903 because of Emmeline Pankhurst and others, frustrated by the lack of progress of the NUWSS, decided more
        direct action was required and founded
        the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with the motto 'Deeds not words'.
